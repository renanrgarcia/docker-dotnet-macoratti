# Images

- When I create a container, I use the read-only layers from the base image and docker adds a read-write layer to it
- If i have to alter a file from the base image, I use the copy-on-write concept. Given that the base image is immutable, I copy the file to the read-write layer.

## Create image

- Dockerfile contains instructions to build an image
- `docker build -t image_name/tag .`: build image from current directory
  - `-t`: tag the image
- `docker login`: login to docker hub
  - `docker push image_name/tag`: push image to docker hub

## Manage images

- `docker image pull <image>`: download image from docker hub
  - If tag is not specified, the latest tag is used
- `docker image inspect <image>`: show details of image
- `docker image history <image>`: show history of image
- `docker image tag <image:tag> <new_image:tag>`: copy image and tag it, referencing the new image. The new one can't be erased, but the base one can be.
- `docker image rm <image>`: remove image

## Publish image on docker hub

- `docker image tag <imagehub:tag> <login_docker>/<image:tag>`: prepare image for pushing to docker hub
- `docker login -u <username> -p <password>`: login to docker hub
- `docker image push <imagehub:tag>`: push image to docker hub
- `docker logout`: logout from docker hub

## Dotnet commands

- `dotnet publish --configuration Release --output <folder>`
  - `--configuration`: release configuration (for production), instead of debug
  - `--output`: output folder
