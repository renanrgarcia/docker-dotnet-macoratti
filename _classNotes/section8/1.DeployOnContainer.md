# Deploy on Container

- Instead of pushing locally the aspnetcore image, we can push it to a docker container

## Docker Multi-Stage Build

- Use multi-stage build to optimize image size
- We can use various stages for different purposes: build, test, deploy
  - Uses "FROM...AS" syntax
- We can pass information between stages using "COPY --from=<stage>"
