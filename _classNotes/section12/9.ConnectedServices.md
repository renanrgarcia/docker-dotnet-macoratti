# Connected Services

- Connected services are a way to connect your app to external services and APIs via Visual Studio.
- They allow you to easily integrate with various services, such as REST APIs, SOAP services, and gRPC services, without having to manually write the code to connect to these services.
- Using `NSwag`, you can generate C# client code (strongly typed) from a Swagger/OpenAPI specification, which can be used to call REST APIs.
