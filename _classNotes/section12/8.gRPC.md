# gRPC

- gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Call) is a high-performance, open-source universal RPC framework that can run in any environment.
  - RPC (Remote Procedure Call) is a protocol that allows a program to execute a procedure on a remote server as if it were a local procedure call.
  - gRPC is based on HTTP/2 and uses Protocol Buffers (protobuf) as its interface definition language (IDL).
- It was developed aiming to make it easier for developers to build distributed systems and microservices.
- Uses the message format Protocol Buffers (protobuf) to define the structure of the messages exchanged between the client and server.
  - It is a language-agnostic binary serialization format that is efficient and compact.
  - Protobuf allows you to define your data structures in a .proto file, which can then be compiled into code for various programming languages.
- They are great for actions (procedures or commands), being a good alternative to REST APIs.

## gRPC vs REST

- gRPC is a modern alternative to REST APIs, offering several advantages:
  - **Performance**: gRPC uses HTTP/2, which allows for multiplexing multiple requests over a single connection, reducing latency and improving performance.
  - **Streaming**: gRPC supports bidirectional streaming, allowing clients and servers to send and receive messages in real-time.
  - **Strongly Typed**: gRPC uses Protocol Buffers for message serialization, providing strong typing and better validation compared to JSON used in REST APIs.
  - **Code Generation**: gRPC can automatically generate client and server code from the .proto file, reducing boilerplate code and improving developer productivity.
  - **Language Agnostic**: gRPC supports multiple programming languages, making it easy to integrate with different systems.
- But is slower to develop and debug than REST APIs, and is not as widely adopted as REST.
  - So, there's few integrated resources for gRPC for compatibility with other systems.
  - On .Net, gRPC can be used with ASP.NET Core.

## ProtoBuf

- Protocol Buffers (protobuf) are serialization/deserialization methods that work through IDL:
  - Specify the structure of the data in a .proto file on neutral language (proto itself).
  - The .proto file is compiled into code for the target programming language.
  - It's only a description of the service, not the implementation.
- Protobuf is a binary format, which makes it more efficient than JSON or XML for data serialization.

## gRPC Service

- Can act as a controller for a gRPC service, similar to how a controller acts for an HTTP API.
