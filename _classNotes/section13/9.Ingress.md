# Ingress

- Ingress is a Kubernetes object that manages external access to services in a cluster using HTTP and HTTPS.
- Traffic routing is controlled by rules defined on the Ingress resource.
- It can provide load balancing, SSL termination, and name-based virtual hosting.
- Acts as a smart router or entry point to the cluster. It permits the secure access to APIs and services at only one domain.
- It depends on the Ingress Controller to work.

## Example with ingress-nginx

- Guide to install on cloud providers using minikube: https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/deploy/#minikube
- Minikube ambient: `minikube addons enable ingress`
- Create a file `frontend-ingress.yaml` containing: apiVersion, kind, metadata, spec.
- The name must be a valid DNS subdomain name.

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1 # Specifies the API version
kind: Ingress # Defines the type of Kubernetes resource
metadata:
  name: frontend-ingress # Name of the Ingress resource
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: / # Annotation to rewrite the URL path
spec:
  rules:
    - host: pizza.local # The host to match for routing traffic
      http:
        paths:
          - path: / # The path to match for routing traffic
            pathType: Prefix # Specifies the type of path matching. Can be Prefix or Exact
            backend:
              service:
                name: pizzafrontend # Name of the service to route traffic to
                port:
                  number: 8080 # Port on which the service is running
```

## Apply the Ingress resource

- `kubectl apply -f frontend-ingress.yml`
- `kubectl get ingress` - Get the Ingress resource
  - Then open the browser and access the URL `http://pizza.local/`

## Ingress Types

- **Ingress supported by only one service**
- **Fanout Ingress**: One Ingress host to expose multiple services based on the URL path.
- **Name-based Virtual Hosting**: Can be multiple hosts, but only one IP address.
- **TLS**: Secure the connection between the client and the server. Kubernetes Secrets are used to store the certificate and key, as passwords, token OAuth, SSH keys, etc.
