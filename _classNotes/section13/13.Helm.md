# Helm

- Package manager for Kubernetes to define, install and upgrade applications.
- It uses a packaging format called charts, which are a collection of files that describe a related set of Kubernetes resources.

## Concepts

- **Chart**: A Helm package of pre-configured definitions for running an application, tool, or service in a Kubernetes cluster. It's organized as a collection of files inside a directory.
- **Repository**: A place where charts can be collected and shared. It's like a package manager repository.
- **Release**: A running instance of a chart in a Kubernetes cluster. A chart can be installed multiple times in the same cluster, each time creating a new release.

## Commands

- `helm search hub <chart-name>`: Search for a chart in the Helm Hub (lists charts from tens of repositories).
  - Ex: `helm search hub wordpress`
- `helm search repo <chart-name>`: Search for a chart in the repositories you have added.
  - Ex: `helm search repo <name1>`
- `helm repo add <repo-name> <repo-url>`: Add a repository to Helm.
  - Ex: `helm repo add stable https://kubernetes-charts.storage.googleapis.com`
- `helm install <release-name> <chart-name>`: Install a chart.
  - Ex: `helm install my-release stable/mysql`
- `helm upgrade <release-name> <chart-name>`: Upgrade a release.
  - Ex: `helm upgrade my-release stable/mysql`
- `helm rollback <release-name> <revision-number>`: Rollback a release to a previous version.
  - Ex: `helm rollback my-release 1`
- `helm uninstall <release-name>`: Uninstall a release.
- `helm create <chart-name>`: Create a new chart.

  - Ex: `helm create my-chart`
  - my-chart/
    - charts/ - dependencies
    - templates/ - Kubernetes resources
    - values.yaml - default values for the chart
    - Chart.yaml - metadata about the chart
    - values.schema.json
  - templates/tests/
    - \_helpers.tpl
    - deployment.yaml
    - hpa.yaml
    - ingress.yaml
    - NOTES.txt
    - service.yaml
    - serviceaccount.yaml

- `Chart.yaml`: Contains metadata about the chart.

```yaml
apiVersion: v2 # The version of the chart API
name: my-chart # The name of the chart
description: A Helm chart for Kubernetes # A short description of the chart
version: 0.1.0 # The version of the chart, to be incremented with each change
type: application # Can be library or application
appVersion: "1.0" # The version of the app
```

- `values.yaml`: Contains the default values for the chart.

```yaml
repository: nginx
pullPolicy: IfNotPresent
Tag: "" # Overrides the image tag whose default is the chart appVersion
---
service:
  type: ClusterIP
  port: 80

ingress:
  enabled: false
  className: ""
  annotations: {}
```

- `helm list`: List releases.
