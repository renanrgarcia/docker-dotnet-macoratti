# Manage Aspnet apps on Kubernetes

- Actions
  - Update deployment
  - Delete objects on Kubernetes
  - Debugging pods on production
  - Executing commands on pods
  - Kubeconfig (Context and clusters)
  - MiniKube: dashboard

## Update deployment

- Change the deployment file
- Run `kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml`

## Delete and update pods

- Delete objects (pods, deployments, services, etc) on Kubernetes
  - `kubectl delete object_type object_name`
- Delete yaml file
  - `kubectl delete -f file.yaml`
  - It will delete all objects in the file and the file stays on the disk

## Debugging pods on production

- Get information about objects on Kubernetes
  - `kubectl get object_type`
- Describing objects (pods, deployments, services, etc) on Kubernetes
  - `kubectl describe object_type object_name`
- Get logs from pods
  - `kubectl logs pod_name -c container_name`

## Executing commands on pods

- Executing commands on pods
  - `kubectl exec -it pod_name -- /bin/bash` or `kubectl exec -it pod_name -- sh`
  - `kubectl exec -it pod_name -- ls`

## Kubeconfig (Context and clusters)

- It's used to configure access to Kubernetes clusters when using `kubectl`(or other tools)
- It's located at `~/.kube/config` (Linux) or `C:\Users\username\.kube\config` (Windows)
- It contains information about clusters, users, authentication mechanisms, and contexts
- It's an YAML file with username and password or token that eliminates the need from the Kubernetes Client to request interactively the credentials.
- `kubectl config <command>` is used to manage the kubeconfig file. Ex:
  - `kubectl config current-context` - Get the current context
  - `kubectl config get-contexts` - Get all contexts (Context: information about the cluster, user, and namespace)
  - `kubectl config get-clusters` - Get all clusters

## MiniKube: dashboard

- `minikube dashboard` - Open the dashboard in the browser
- `minikube dashboard --url` - Get the URL of the dashboard
- Used to:
  - Deploy an app on a container in the cluster
  - Solve problems with the cluster
  - Create and delete objects (pods, deployments, services, etc)
  - Scale a deployment, update apps, restart a pod, etc
