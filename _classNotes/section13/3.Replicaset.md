# Replicaset

- `Naked pods` means that they are not managed by any controller, because it was created directly with the `kubectl` command.
  - If the pod crashes, it will not be restarted.
- `ReplicaSet` is a controller that ensures a specified number of pod replicas are running at all times.
  - If a pod crashes, the ReplicaSet will create a new one.
- `Labels` are key-value pairs that are used to identify the pods that the ReplicaSet will manage.
- `Selector` is a field in the ReplicaSet that specifies the labels that the ReplicaSet will manage.

## ReplicaSet Structure

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: ReplicaSet
metadata:
  name: redis-replicaset # Name of the ReplicaSet
  labels:
    app: myApp # Label to identify the application
    type: database # Label to identify the type of pod
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      name: mypod # Name of the pod template
      labels:
        app: myApp # Label to identify the application
        type: database # Label to identify the type of pod
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: cont-redis # Name of the container
          image: redis # Docker image to use for the container
          ports:
            - containerPort: 80 # Port exposed by the container
  replicas: 3 # Number of pod replicas to maintain
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      type: database # Selector to match pods with the label 'type: database'
```

### Creating a ReplicaSet

- `kubectl apply -f replicaset1.yaml` or `kubectl create -f replicaset1.yaml`
- `kubectl scale replicaset redis-replicaset --replicas=5`: Scales the number of replicas to 5.
  - If we try to create more pods than the replicas specified in the ReplicaSet, the ReplicaSet will delete the extra pods.
- Limitation: ReplicaSet does not support rolling updates. For that, we need to use `Deployment`.
