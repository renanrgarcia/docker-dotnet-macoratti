# Networks

- Software Defined Network (SDN) or Virtualized Network
  - Docker connects its containers to a internal network and give them IP addresses, for them to communicate with each other and with the outside world.
- `docker network inspect <network>`: to inspect a network
  - Default Network: bridge
  - See the ip addresses of the containers in the network
- `docker network ls`: list existing networks
- `docker network inspect <network>`: inspect a network
- `docker network create [--driver <driver_name>] <network_name>`: create a network. Driver bridge is default
- `docker container run -it --name <container_name> --network|net <network_name> <image>`: run container in network
  - On custom network the container name can be used as a host name
- `docker network connect <container_name> <network_name>`: connect container to network

- `hostname -i`: get the ip address of the current machine (inside container)

## Network types

- host: host server network
- none: doesn't have connectivity, used to isolate containers
- bridge: default network, docker adds the containers to this network. Unless they are explicitly connected to another network

## Custom networks

- `docker container run -d --name mysql -v productsdata:/var/lib/mysql --network backend -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=password -e bind-address=0.0.0.0 mysql:5.7`
  - There is not mapped ports and the host cannot connect to the DB. Only get connected from backend network
- `docker create --name mvcapp[x] -e DBHOST=mysql --network backend productsmvc/app:2.0` > x = number of containers running
- `docker network connect frontend mvcapp[x]` > x = number of containers running
- `docker container start mvcapp1 mvcapp2 mvcapp3`

## Load balancing

- `docker container run -d --name loadbalancer --network frontend -v $(pwd)/haproxy.cfg:/usr/local/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg -p 3200:80 haproxy:1.7.0`
  - On windows: `docker container run -d --name loadbalancer --network frontend -v ${PWD}/haproxy.cfg:/usr/local/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg -p 3200:80 haproxy:1.7.0`
