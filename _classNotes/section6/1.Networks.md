# Networks

- Software Defined Network (SDN) or Virtualized Network
  - Docker connects its containers to a internal network and give them IP addresses, for them to communicate with each other and with the outside world.
- `docker network inspect <network>`: to inspect a network
  - Default Network: bridge
  - See the ip addresses of the containers in the network
- `docker network ls`: list existing networks
- `docker network inspect <network>`: inspect a network

## Network types

- host: host server network
- none: doesn't have connectivity, used to isolate containers
- bridge: default network, docker adds the containers to this network. Unless they are explicitly connected to another network
